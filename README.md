jjson
=====

JSON helper library for Android and Java

It is based on the Android library https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/master/json/
and also using some the Json utils from https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/util
which are almost the same the the GSON ones.


JJson is quite fast especially when generating a Json Map Object from a Json String.

It can be used on Android and Java in general.
