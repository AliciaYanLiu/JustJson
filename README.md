jjson
=====

JSON helper library for Android and Java
--

It came of the need for simple and lightweight Json parser for Android(unlinke Jackson), however fast and performant(unlike smart/simple json).
The code started as a mixture of https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libcore/+/master/json/ and the Json utils from https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/master/core/java/android/util .

JJson is quite fast when generating a Json Map Objects form String or Reader.

It can be used on Android and Java in general.

Features
==
- Fast and easy Json Pasrser and Writer (comparable or better performance than Android Native, GSON and Jackson libraries)
- Flexible Json Wrapper helper implementations that hold json data and media type. Ideal for Model classes.
- Json-Schema validation and UI generation for Android (TODO)
